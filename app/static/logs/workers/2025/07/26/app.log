The TV show Blue Bloods is a police family story that airs on CBS. It stars Tom Selleck, Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Will Estes, Len Cariou, Marisa Ramirez, and Vanessa Ray. The actors who play the same role over and over are Abigail Hawk, Gregory Jbara, Robert Clohessy, Steve Schirripa, Dylan Walsh, and Will Hochman. There are guest stars like Malik Yoba and Jennifer Esposito. The show is about the Reagans, a family of New York City police officers that goes through many generations and is committed to their job. Patriarch Frank Reagan (Selleck) is the commissioner of the New York Police Department. He runs it with the same level of tactfulness that he runs his family. Henry (Cariou), his unapologetically brave father, was Chief before. Daniel (Wahlberg), Frank\\u2019s oldest son, is a detective with a lot of experience, a family man, and a veteran of the Iraq War. He makes Frank proud and worries about him. Danny and his partner, Detective Maria Baez (Ramirez), sometimes use questionable methods to solve crimes. The daughter of Frank, Erin Moynahan, works as an assistant district attorney in New York. Jamie (Estes), Frank\\u2019s youngest child, is the \\u201cgolden boy\\u201d of the family and a Harvard Law graduate. He turned down a successful career as a lawyer to become a police officer like his family did. Eddie Janko, also known as Ray, is married to Jamie and is also a cop.

Patriarch Frank Reagan (Selleck) is the commissioner of the New York Police Department. He runs it with the same level of tactfulness that he runs his family. Henry (Cariou), his unapologetically brave father, was Chief before. Daniel (Wahlberg), Frank’s oldest son, is a detective with a lot of experience, a family man, and a veteran of the Iraq War. He makes Frank proud and worries about him. Danny and his partner, Detective Maria Baez (Ramirez), sometimes use questionable methods to solve crimes. The daughter of Frank, Erin Moynahan, works as an assistant district attorney in New York. Jamie (Estes), Frank’s youngest child, is the “golden boy” of the family and a Harvard Law graduate.
