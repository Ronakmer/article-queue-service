Who might be back for season 4 of Tokyo Revengers ? What might happen in the season 4 of Tokyo Revengers? Do WE have a trailer for season 4 of Tokyo Revengers? Where to watch Tokyo Revengers Season 1-3? Will there be a season 4 of Tokyo Revengers? Radio Times says that So far, public announcement about Tokyo Revengers season 4 has yet to be published. However, since the show’s third season just started, we might hear something soon after the current run ends. Watch this page, and we’ll let you know as soon as we learn more. When might the fourth season of Tokyo Revengers come out? About two years passed between Tokyo Revengers seasons 1 and 2, with season 2 starting on January 8, 2023, nearly two years after season 1. This is about how long we usually say the time between seasons is. But there is the vast surprise of season 3, which started just six months after season 2 ended on April 2, 2023. Season 3 began on October 4, 2023. It’s hard to say when Tokyo Revengers season 4 will come out, but if season 3 is about the same length as season 2, with 13 episodes, then we can expect season 4 to come out in late 2024. If you’re curious about the upcoming anime series, feel free to delve into our earlier posts where we’ve delved into all the details surrounding its release. Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead Season 2 Dr. Stone Season 4 Release Date Gate Season 3 Release Date Season 4 of Mob Psycho 100? Who might be back for season 4 of Tokyo Revengers ? We think the following cast members will be back for the fourth season as long as there are no fights behind the scenes: Inui Seishu, played by Junya Enoki. Yuuki Shin as Takemichi Hanagaki, Yuu Hayashi as Manjiro Sano, Natsuki Hanae as Kokonoi Hajime, Tasuku Hatanaka as Hakkai Shiba, and Izana Kurokawa. Tetsu Inada as Kanji Mochizuki. What might happen in the season 4 of Tokyo Revengers? Many people think that the Tenjiku Arc is one of the best in the history of the manga, and Season 3 is all about it. The next arc is the Bonten Arc, which includes Chapters 187–206 of the manga. We expect season 4 to cover this arc, so we look forward to the Tokyo Manji Gang breaking up and returning to the future, where almost everything seems to be precisely how Takemichi wanted it to be. That is, except Mikey doesn’t seem to be there… We hope Tokyo Revengers gets picked up for a fourth season because saying much more would give away another great story arc. Do WE have a trailer for season 4 of Tokyo Revengers? There has yet to be an official introduction, teaser, or trailer for Tokyo Revengers’ fourth season, but we’ll make sure this page is updated as soon as there is one.
